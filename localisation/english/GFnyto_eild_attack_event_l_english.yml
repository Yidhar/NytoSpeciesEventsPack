Infection Zone's ecology are in a sense entered another type of biosphere cycle, there's silicized and crystalized trees, even with some silicized fungus, turning dead ELID-infected into silicon compounds. If we do not wish for our home planet to §Rfall§!, then we must think of a way to solve this threat. "

 GFnytoeild.35.desc:0 "We have discovered earky stage ELID-infected brain waves demonstrates instability in α rhythms, some areas shows high frequency β waves, θ wave activity has increased significantly, sometimes can observe θ waves in all areas. As the condition worsens, the α wave activity in the brain waves slows to a stop, major increase to β waves, in rare cases can see groups of large scale high frequency δ waves. Scientists has trial produced some civilian versions of brain wave resonators and using small size ELID-infected to conduct some live tests, the experiment was very successful, those ELID-infected starts to listen to our orders. They plan on scaling up to start producing brain wave resonators for military use. "
