GFNYTO_START_SCREEN_1:0 "In the early stages of civilization, we have been accidentally activated in a long barren underground laboratory, clinging to life like moles under this wasteland. Dangerous surface and harsh enviroments interwined the early, chaotic times of our history, and eventually catalyzed a whole new polity, continuing our brittle civilization. In the following investigations to ancient civilizations, we discovered that our species are named 'Nyto', and the underground lab once belonged to an organization named 'Paradeus'."
GFNYTO_START_SCREEN_2:0 "Even if just one survivor may knock the gateway of Zion, ourt existence will have but an eternal home. However the moment we stepped into Zion, we found that the home was a lie. The parents long sleeps, abandoned their children. Awakened us just to open the tomb, all that is left are nothing but regrets and hatred."
