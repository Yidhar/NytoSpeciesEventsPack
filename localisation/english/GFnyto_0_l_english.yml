 GFNYTO_START_SCREEN_1:0 "In the early stages of civilization, we have been accidentally activated in a long barren underground laboratory, clinging to life like moles under this wasteland. Dangerous surface and harsh enviroments interwined the early, chaotic times of our history, and eventually catalyzed a whole new polity, continuing our brittle civilization. In the following investigations to ancient civilizations, we discovered that our species are named 'Nyto', and the underground lab once belonged to an organization named 'Paradeus'."
 GFNYTO_START_SCREEN_2:0 "Even if just one survivor may knock the gateway of Zion, ourt existence will have but an eternal home. However the moment we stepped into Zion, we found that the home was a lie. The parents long sleeps, abandoned their children. Awakened us just to open the tomb, all that is left are nothing but regrets and hatred."

They are borrowing material from their own future. Specifically, putting in 100 units of substance goes in and harvesting 200 or more units of substance.

Time, looking back on itself, coiled in an impossible spiral and bursting with longing. Gravity. Love? No - attraction. The Worm's nature is to attract. Its grip is so tight that this universe cannot be born again. The Worm imprisons itself in its purpose. Impotent, it looks for a way out. Or a way in. To attract MORE.\n\nDid it send us the temple of the Loop, an artifice not from our time to lure us here? It is so terribly clever, so awfully loving. We found our way to it, delivered unto it that which can free it. Its escape will take an eternity, or two, but the Worm is still grateful, and promises to embrace us.\n\nForever."

This universe is no more, time collapsing in a spiral, layer upon layer, with the embers of hope trickling down from the shattered firmament.\n\nIn a forgotten corner of time, we found an entity called Lunasia, stubbornly curled up in a nook of history, carefully cherishing the tiny sliver of hope in her embrace. Perhaps it represents a beautiful past we've never witnessed. Behind Lunasia, countless fragments called Jefuti are falling or drifting past, so busily occupied that no one notices our arrival. Lunasia is self-imprisoned within the past. Jefuti desperately searches for a glimmer of possibility.\n\nRuins, Zion. Our story has spanned too many worlds, too many regrets. But this time, we have arrived here. After spending one or two eternities, we found the path to the \"End\" and handed it to Lunasia and Jefuti. The girls rested briefly, offered us their gratitude, and once again embarked on their journey home.\n\nOn a long journey, some will always go ahead, and some will join along the way.\n"
