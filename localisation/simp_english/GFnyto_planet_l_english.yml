Spirit of God operates on the water surface.The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in the earth, and [that] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was] only evil continually. And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life, from under heaven; [and] every thing that [is] in the earth shall die. Dark days awaits, God in all his mercy and wisdom moves Josiah to eternal confort."
