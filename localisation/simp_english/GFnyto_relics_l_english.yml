site_nyto_unknown_civilization_202055_desc:0 "From the birth of the first kingdom in Mesopotalia plains, even from the days when the first Mammoth runs the icefields, this planet has been littered with primordial cavernous ruins, former humans benefitted from it, died from it, and so is the birth of our people. Now this land is raging with Collapse radiation pollution, this is the result of a former human era exploration failure. Even though they have invested much into decyphering and development of the ruins, but even to their destruction they did not discover the answer. Now, it is our turn to take over, our scientists wishes to find the reason to our birth in these ruins, and the source of their technology from the roots. Even with the risk of repeating history again, yet, some destiny feeling drives us..."

gfnytoparadeusancrel.2001.desc:0 "This was once called Ruin one by the former USSR, this is also the birth place of the first sapient AI. We today return here, attempt to find clues to genesis. \n\n We have found a large listening post near the ruin called Devil's Peak, remaining records shows that, this was once recording the electric signals of the ruin, and we hope to find some clues here. \n\n Damned, time has corroded this place too hard, we found nothing of value. Even though they kept a full channel surveillence, but we have found nothing. Why is this happening? \n\n We returned to the camps, examined once more records left by the former humans, however, every time the ruin is involved, the records are oddly damaged, we think this not to be a coincidence. Something happened and this caused the humans to execute a massive record deletion project—— as if they knew someone is coming. Whether these deletions are voluntary, the existence of the ruin becomes clouded. \n\n We have restored some clues in other insignificant places.. now, we will leave for Ижевск, Izhevsk ruin, lastly... we want to submit request for more funds, better to establish a full department. Relic site digging should be a major project that cannot be overlooked. "

gfnytoparadeusancrel.2002.desc:0 "Izhevsk was the famous military/light arms production city of the former USSR, we are here today because, we discovered a named report here,  with content written as “Gravity field in the ruin is a signal system responding or controlling other ruins. yet from the analysis of Ruin One, our monitored signals are the signals of the system's control circuits. With the technology of humans in consideration, simulating this system or producing similar signals is impossible, but we can make a math model based off analysis......”, truthfully, humans of the last era could not yet analyze the signals when they left this document, yet, we here today in Nordhausen Ruin heres nothing but silence, perhaps.. perhaps the signals need something to be activated?  Under the situation of no advancement, our scholars had but to blindly guess.\n\n。Our conjecture was correct! we scanned down large amounts of underground structures below the ruin, when we enter it, prospectors discovered it to be a large automated system, this means that USSR had successfully completed the decyphering of the ruin signals, anbd tried to construct a simulation here. In the process, we found that the control systenm is a trinary computer, when the machine turns on it emits specified electromagnetic waves out, with clear purpose. However, we cannot truly activate this system, its energy has been cut, circuits degraded, chips worn. Its wise to say that it's surprising that this system preserved this long here underground. We need to hurry out, and verify our findings in Nordhausen"

What does Ruin one's signal means, what is it continuously sending out? We know not of, the research slows to halt. \n\n Breakthrough！By conducting analysis of mathematic models of the signal, we found it to be very similar to our known OGAS system. to analyze it needs to source back to the first trinary computer used for automation. And we happens to know exactly where it is！Сетунь"
