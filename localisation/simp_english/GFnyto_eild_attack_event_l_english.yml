GFnytoeild.1.desc:0 "The documented ELID-infected are mostly turned by huamns, and in the high Collapse fluid radiation concentration areas, ELID-infected becomes must more diverse, for example bears with skin silicidation; Deers with 4 meter size horns; Half a meter large spiders spitting highky corrosive acids to hunt other ELID-infected. Infection Zone's ecology are in a sense entered another type of biosphere cycle, there's silicized and crystalized trees, even with some silicized fungus, turning dead ELID-infected into silicon compounds. If we do not wish for our home planet to §Rfall§!, then we must think of a way to solve this threat. "

GFnytoeild.35.name:0 "ELID-infected New breakthrough"
GFnytoeild.35.desc:0 "We have discovered earky stage ELID-infected brain waves demonstrates instability in α rhythms, some areas shows high frequency β waves, θ wave activity has increased significantly, sometimes can observe θ waves in all areas. As the condition worsens, the α wave activity in the brain waves slows to a stop, major increase to β waves, in rare cases can see groups of large scale high frequency δ waves. Scientists has trial produced some civilian versions of brain wave resonators and using small size ELID-infected to conduct some live tests, the experiment was very successful, those ELID-infected starts to listen to our orders. They plan on scaling up to start producing brain wave resonators for military use. "
